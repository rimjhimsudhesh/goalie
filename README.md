# AI-Generated Personal Planning Calendar

This project uses Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3), AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to generate **personalized weekly plans** based on user-selected hobbies.  
The generated activities are mapped to a calendar-style frontend for users to visualize and act on their goals!

---

## Features

- Select a hobby or focus area (e.g., Exercise, Creativity, Reading, Relaxation).
- Generate a **personalized 7-day plan** using an AI model (Claude 3 via Bedrock).
- Store generated plans in a DynamoDB table (`goals`).
- Fetch and display the generated plan as **calendar events** in the frontend.
- Dynamically map AI-generated activities to real-world dates.

## How It Works

1. **User selects a hobby** from a dropdown menu.
2. **Frontend sends a prompt** to an HTTP API Gateway endpoint.
3. **AWS Lambda parses the prompt**, sends a custom message to Claude 3 via Bedrock.
4. **Bedrock generates a structured JSON output** â€” a weekly plan of activities.
5. **Lambda stores the plan** into a DynamoDB table and returns it to the frontend.
6. **Frontend parses the response** and maps activities onto a calendar.
